## Abstract
The challenge for this Mint Bean Hackathon was to create an app that users can make art in a visual format. Rosso allows users to draw free form lines in varying thickness, choose a color to paint with from 4 different color palettes based on earth themes, listen to soothing nature sounds in order to feel the colors, as well as have the ability to make happy accidents (aka erase parts of their drawing). The landing page gives users a feel for the app and a chance to meet the creators.
